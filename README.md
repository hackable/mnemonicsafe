# MnemonicSafe

![Node.js CI](https://github.com/hackable/mnemonicsafe/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg)

MnemonicSafe is a secure backup solution for cryptocurrency mnemonics. Inspired by the ideas behind SLIP-39, MnemonicSafe splits a BIP-39 mnemonic into multiple shares using Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) and then encrypts each share using AES-256-GCM with unique passwords. This approach requires a threshold number of shares to reconstruct the original mnemonic, thereby enhancing security and resilience against loss or compromise.

> **Disclaimer:**  
> MnemonicSafe is an educational and experimental project and is not an official implementation of SLIP-39 by SatoshiLabs. Use this code for testing and research purposes only, and never expose real mnemonics without a thorough security review.

## Overview

MnemonicSafe works by:

1. **Converting the mnemonic into entropy:**  
   The provided BIP-39 mnemonic is validated and converted into its underlying binary entropy.

2. **Splitting the entropy using Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS):**  
   The entropy is divided into multiple shares such that only a configurable threshold of shares is required to reconstruct the original secret.

3. **Encrypting each share:**  
   Each share is converted into a Base64 string and then encrypted using AES-256-GCM. A unique password is used for each share, and robust key derivation (using PBKDF2 with a random salt) ensures strong encryption.

4. **Reconstructing the mnemonic:**  
   By decrypting a threshold number of shares with their corresponding passwords and combining them via SSS, the original mnemonic is recovered.

While our code is sometimes called "SLIP-39" in this repository, note that SLIP-39 is a standard developed by SatoshiLabs. MnemonicSafe is inspired by these ideas but does not adhere to the official SLIP-39 specification.

## Features

- **BIP-39 Mnemonic Conversion:** Validates and converts mnemonics to entropy.
- **Secret Splitting with SSS:** Splits the mnemonic's entropy into multiple shares.
- **AES-256-GCM Encryption:** Encrypts each share with its own password using PBKDF2 key derivation, random salt, and IV.
- **Share Reconstruction:** Combines a threshold number of decrypted shares to recover the original mnemonic.
- **Extensible Design:** Ready for future enhancements like expiration metadata or threshold encryption.

## Usage

### Splitting a Mnemonic into Encrypted Shares

In the `example.js` file, a sample BIP-39 mnemonic is defined along with a configuration for splitting the mnemonic into shares:

- **Mnemonic:**  
  `legal winner thank year wave sausage worth useful legal winner thank yellow`

- **Configuration:**
  - **Total Shares:** 5
  - **Threshold:** 3
  - **Passwords:** Unique password for each share (e.g., `password1!`, `password2@`, etc.)

## The Process Involves:

1. Converting the mnemonic into entropy.
2. Splitting the entropy into 5 shares using Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS).
3. Encrypting each share with its corresponding password using AES-256-GCM.

### Reconstructing the Mnemonic

The reconstruction process:

1. Selects a threshold number of encrypted shares.
2. Decrypts them using the corresponding passwords.
3. Reassembles the original mnemonic using Shamirâ€™s Secret Sharing.

### Running the Example

To run the example and see the complete process:
